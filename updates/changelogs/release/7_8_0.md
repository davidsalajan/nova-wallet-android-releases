Staking Proxies are here in Nova Wallet v7.8.0! 🎁

You can now set and control your Staking Proxy account in Nova Wallet!

Staking Proxies allow you to delegate authority over staking operations to another account – so you can keep your assets safe in a cold storage wallet whilst being able to change validators, add to your stake, unbond and more from your Staking Proxy account!
